## Overview


This repo contains notebooks for Pytorch Serving Workshop.


To get started, run the below notebook that will setup everything in collab. 

**Colab** starter notebook: &nbsp;&nbsp; [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/npatta01/pytorch-serving-workshop/blob/notebooks/colab_starter.ipynb)


## Contents

There are five notebooks.

a. 00_prepare_dataset.ipynb

Notebook that prepares the e-comeerce dataset and saves it.

b. 01_train.ipynb

Trains a DistilBert model

c. 02_inference_review.ipynb

Notebook that shows how to use the HuggingFace ecosystem. Also shows how to use the trained model from previous notebook.

d. 03_optimizing_model.ipynb

Notebook that shows impact of Quantization and TorschScript


e. 04_packaging.ipynb
